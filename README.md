# ðŸ“« PubSub

> A simple pub/sub written in Typescript

```
npm install @dldc/pubsub
```

## Gist

```ts
import { createSubscription } from "@dldc/pubsub";

const mySub = createSubscription<number>();

const unsub = mySub.subscribe((num) => {
  console.log("num: " + num);
});

mySub.emit(45); // num: 45

unsub();
```

## Guide

### Creating a Subscription

To create a `Subscription` you need to import the `createSubscription` function
and call it.

```ts
import { createSubscription } from "@dldc/pubsub";

const subscription = createSubscription();
```

If you use TypeScript, you need to pass a type parameter to the
`createSubscription` function to define the type of the value associated with
the subscription.

```ts
import { createVoidSubscription } from "@dldc/pubsub";

const numSubscription = createSubscription<number>();
```

If you don't want your subscription to emit any value, you can use the
`createVoidSubscription` function.

```ts
import { createVoidSubscription } from "@dldc/pubsub";

const voidSubscription = createVoidSubscription();
```

### Subscribe and Unsubscribe

You have two ways to `subscribe` / `unsubscribe`.

- Using the reference of the callback function

```ts
const callback = () => {
  /*...*/
};

subscription.subscribe(callback);
// later
subscription.unsubscribe(callback);
```

- Using a SubId (a string)

```ts
subscription.subscribeById("mySubId", () => {
  /*...*/
});
// later
subscription.unsubscribeById("mySubId");
```

In both case the `subscribe[ById]` return a function that will unsubscribe:

```ts
const unsub = subscription.subscribe(/*...*/);
// later
unsub();
```

### Emitting value

To emit a value and trigger all subscribed `callback` you need to call the
`emit` method.

```ts
subscription.emit(42);
// for void subscription you don't need to pass any value
voidSubscription.emit();
```

### OnUnsubscribe

The `subscribe[ById]` methods accept a optional function after the callback,
this function will be called when this callback you are subscribing is
unsubscribed.

```ts
subscription.subscribe(
  () => {
    /* ... */
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Unsubscribed !");
  },
);

// or with a subId
subscription.subscribeById(
  "mySub",
  () => {
    /* ... */
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Unsubscribed !");
  },
);
```

### Unsubscribing all subscriptions

You can call `unsubscribeAll` method on a subscription to remove all callback.
This will also trigger the `onUnsubscribe` if any.

```ts
subscription.unsubscribeAll();
```

### `Subscription` options

The `createSubscription` (or `createVoidSubscription`) functions accept an
option object as parameter (all properties are optional):

```ts
const sub = Subscription.create({
  onFirstSubscription: () => {},
  onLastUnsubscribe: () => {},
  onDestroy: () => {},
  maxSubscriptionCount: 10000,
  maxRecursiveEmit: 1000,
  maxUnsubscribeAllLoop: 1000,
});
```

#### `onFirstSubscription`

> A function called when the number of subscribers goes from `0` to `1`

#### `onLastUnsubscribe`

> A function called when the number of subscribers goes from `1` to `0`

#### `onDestroy`

> A function called when the `destroy` method is called. Note that during this
> call the `Subscription` is already destroyed and you can't call `emit` or
> `subscribe` anymore.

#### `maxSubscriptionCount`

> A number to limit the maximum number of simultaneous subscriptions (default is
> `10000`). This limit exist to detect infinit subscription loop.

#### `maxRecursiveEmit`

> A number to limit the maximum recursive call of `emit` (default is `1000`).
> This limit exist to detect infinite loop where you `emit` in a `callback`.

#### `maxUnsubscribeAllLoop`

> A number to limit the maximum recursive call of `subscribe` inside a
> `onUnsubscribe` callback (default is `1000`).

### Testing if a callback / subId is subscribed

The `isSubscribed[ById]` methods let you test whether or not a callback / subId
is currently subscribed

```ts
subscription.isSubscribed(myCallback); // <- boolean
subscription.isSubscribedById("my-sub-id"); // <- boolean
```

### Reading the number of active Subscriptions

You can call the `size` method to get the number of subscriptions.

```ts
subscription.size();
```

### Destroying a Subscription

You can call the `destroy` method to destroy a subscription. This will
unsubscribe all callback and call the `onDestroy` option if any.

```ts
subscription.destroy();
```

Once destroyed, calling `emit` or `subscribe[ById]` will throw an error. You can
still call the other methods but they will have no effect.

You can check if a subscription is destroyed by calling the `isDestroyed`
method.

```ts
subscription.isDestroyed(); // <- boolean
```

## Some precisions

#### Callback are called in the order they are subscribed.

#### If you re-subscribe the same callback or id it will not re-do a subscription but instead move the subscription to the end.

In other words, calling `subscribe` on an already subscribed callback or subId
will not make the callback called twice. But it will move the callback at the
end of the subscription list. In the case of a subId, the callback will be
replaced by the new one.

#### If you call `unsubscribe` in a callback it will have effect immediatly.

If the callback you unsubscribe is supposed to run after the current callback,
it will not be called.

#### If you `subscribe` in a callback it will not be called immediatly.

But it will be in the next `emit`.

#### If you `emit()` in a callback it will defer the call to after the current emit is done.

#### If you `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` / `emit` in an `onUnsubscribed` it will behave the same as if it was in the callback itself

#### Calling `destroy` will unsubscribe all callback and call the `onUnsubscribe` if any

In these `onUnsubscribe` callback the subscription is considered destroyed so
you can't call `emit` or `subscribe` anymore.

#### Calling `destroy` on a destroyed subscription will have no effect

This is a no-op, it will not call `onDestroy` again.

#### The subscription is already considered destroyed when `onDestroy` is called

This means that you can't call `emit` or `subscribe` in the `onDestroy` callback
and that `isDestroyed` will return `true` in the `onDestroy` callback.

## Scheduler [ADVANCED]

At the core of the `Subscription` is a scheduler that will manage the different
callbacks and their order of execution. If you need a single subscription or
event multiple that don't interact with each other, you don't need to know about
the scheduler. But if you need for example to subscribe to a subscription in the
callback of another subscription then keep reading.

### Resuse the same scheduler for multiple subscriptions

You can create a `Scheduler` unsing the `createScheduler` function. You can then
pass this scheduler as the first option of the `createSubscription` and
`createVoidSubscription` functions.

```ts
import { createScheduler, createSubscription } from "@dldc/pubsub";

const scheduler = createScheduler();

const sub1 = createSubscription(scheduler);
const sub2 = createSubscription(scheduler);
```

Note that the `createScheduler` function accept the same options as the
`createSubscription` function. When you pass a scheduler to create a
subscription, you can also pass a second argument to specify a
`onFirstSubscription` and `onLastUnsubscribe` function specific to this
subscription.

```ts
import { createScheduler, createSubscription } from "@dldc/pubsub";

const scheduler = createScheduler();

const sub1 = createSubscription(scheduler, {
  onFirstSubscription: () => {
    console.log("First subscription");
  },
  onLastUnsubscribe: () => {
    console.log("Last unsubscribe");
  },
});
```

### Destrying a scheduler

Note that when you destroy a scheduler, all subscriptions that use this
scheduler will be destroyed as well. Calling `.destroy()` on a subscription will
actually call `.destroy()` on the scheduler.
